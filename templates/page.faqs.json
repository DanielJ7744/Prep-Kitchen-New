            "answer": "<p>Sustainability is something we’re passionate about, so we’d love it if you could recycle our packaging after use! The trays are delivered in insulated cardboard boxes with ice packs to keep them at safe temperatures. The box can be recycled along with the plastic container and lid. Our ice packs are water-soluble – they can be cut open and poured into a sink, and the plastic casing can be recycled. The box liner \/ padding is recyclable depending on your location.<\/p>"
